## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 (Initial Release)

This is the first release of FL-Fog, introducing a complete fog computing layer for federated learning. The system bridges edge devices and cloud infrastructure, providing regional aggregation, intelligent caching, and dynamic orchestration.

**Key Highlights:**
- Production-ready fog node implementation
- Comprehensive testing and CI/CD
- Docker containerization
- Prometheus monitoring
- Security-first design
- Modular and extensible architecture

**Getting Started:**
```bash
# Install FL-Fog
pip install fl-fog

# Run fog node
fl-fog --config config/fog_config.yaml

# Or with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/your-org/fl-fog:latest
```

**Next Steps:**
- Add support for advanced FL algorithms
- Implement predictive caching
- Enhance inter-fog collaboration
- Add ML-driven optimization
- Extend monitoring capabilities

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see the [README](README.md) and [documentation](docs/).
